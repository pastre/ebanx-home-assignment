# ebanx-home-assignment
This is my submission to the EBANX home assignment

To run it, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) installed. Then, clone this repository, change directory into it, and run the following commands

```
  cd ebanxtest
  
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  
  python manage.py runserver

```

This should open the server on localhost port 8000
